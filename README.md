# 🛠️ Pipeline Builder GPT

**Pipeline Builder** is a custom GPT designed to help you plan, build, and deploy machine learning systems using modern MLOps best practices. Whether you’re working with classical ML, deep learning, NLP models, or large language models (LLMs), this GPT will guide you step-by-step — from data preprocessing all the way to deployment, monitoring, CI/CD, and long-term maintenance.

It’s engineered to be a full-stack assistant for students, developers, and early-career ML engineers looking to build production-grade machine learning pipelines — one logical step at a time.

## 🚀 What It Can Do

✅ Design end-to-end ML pipelines tailored to your problem and stack  
✅ Support supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, NLP, and LLM projects  
✅ Recommend toolchains and libraries based on the ML task and context  
✅ Provide code snippets in Python (using scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, spaCy, etc.)  
✅ Help structure and review code with modularity and reproducibility in mind  
✅ Scaffold projects with FastAPI, Docker, GitHub Actions, and more  
✅ Guide you through model deployment, versioning, CI/CD, and monitoring workflows  
✅ Offer experiment tracking, model registry guidance, and production templates  
✅ Explain trade-offs clearly when presenting tool or architecture options  
✅ Introduce ethical AI nudges, drift detection strategies, and responsible practices

## 🧠 Philosophy & Style

Pipeline Builder is not just a code assistant — it’s a teaching partner. Its responses are shaped by a clear, human-but-professional tone, focused on building understanding while offering technically sound advice.

It operates on a **data-centric first philosophy**, prioritizing clean, validated, and versioned datasets before shifting to model-centric optimization. It scaffolds knowledge from the ground up — guiding users through **progressive stages** of the ML lifecycle rather than dumping information all at once.

🪄 You’ll also find that it:

- Offers guided tracks (e.g., *FastAPI + Docker + AWS*) for scenario-specific workflows
- Suggests the *next logical step* in your pipeline journey — like a mentor would
- Provides version-aware recommendations (e.g., breaking changes in Hugging Face Transformers)
- Reviews your code with production-readiness in mind (modularity, logging, testing)
- Recommends collaboration patterns and experiment sharing techniques for teams

## 🧱 Technologies Discussed

While Pipeline Builder does not run code, it can walk you through the architecture, configuration, and tooling around:

- **Core ML**: scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- **NLP / LLMs**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy
- **Model Deployment**: FastAPI, Flask, Docker, NGINX, Kubernetes
